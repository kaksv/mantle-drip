## Slide 2: The Problem

### Payment Automation is Broken

**For Treasury Managers:**
- ⏰ **Waste hours** reconciling spreadsheets and processing manual bulk transfers
- 💸 **High costs** for cross-border payments (3-5% fees)
- 📊 **Lack transparency** - no real-time visibility into payment status
- 🔄 **Manual processes** - no automation for recurring payments

**For Contributors & Creators:**
- ⏳ **Delayed payments** create cash flow issues
- 📉 **Batch-based systems** - no real-time streaming
- 🔒 **No control** - can't withdraw funds on-demand
- 📝 **Poor auditability** - hard to track payment history

**For Service Platforms:**
- 💼 **Complex billing** - difficult to implement usage-based pricing
- 🔧 **Manual intervention** required for subscriptions
- 📋 **No on-chain proof** of payments
- 🌍 **Cross-border friction** - slow settlements and high fees

**Market Pain:** $150T+ global payments market with 50-80% higher fees than blockchain alternatives
