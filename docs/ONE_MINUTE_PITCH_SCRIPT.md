# One-Minute Pitch Script for Drip

## Script (Approximately 150 words - 60 seconds at normal pace)

---

### Opening (5 seconds)
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm here to introduce Drip - programmable payment streams and subscriptions on Celo."

---

### Background (10 seconds)
"In today's digital economy, we're seeing massive growth in creator economies, DAOs, and service platforms. But these organizations face a critical challenge: how do you efficiently manage recurring payments, contributor payouts, and usage-based billing at scale?"

---

### The Problem (15 seconds)
"The current payment infrastructure is broken. Treasury managers waste hours on manual bulk transfers and pay 3-5% in cross-border fees. Contributors face delayed payments and cash flow issues. Service platforms struggle with complex billing and lack on-chain proof of payments. In a $150 trillion global payments market, we're paying 50-80% more in fees than necessary."

---

### The Solution (15 seconds)
"Drip solves this with autonomous payment infrastructure built on Celo. We enable real-time payment streaming that accrues per second, recurring subscriptions with automatic execution, and comprehensive treasury management - all powered by smart contracts. It's transparent, cost-effective, and requires zero manual intervention."

---

### How It Works (10 seconds)
"Here's how simple it is: First, create a stream or subscription by selecting recipients and payment parameters. The smart contract locks funds and begins autonomous distribution. Recipients see real-time balances and can withdraw instantly with one click. Every transaction is recorded on-chain for complete transparency and auditability."

---

### Closing (5 seconds)
"Drip is live on Celo mainnet, ready to transform how organizations handle payments. Let's automate payments, stream value, and build trust together. Thank you."

---

## Alternative Shorter Version (45 seconds)

"Hi, I'm [Your Name] with Drip - programmable payment streams on Celo.

Today's organizations - DAOs, creators, service platforms - waste hours on manual payments and pay 3-5% in fees. In a $150 trillion market, that's billions wasted.

Drip solves this with autonomous smart contracts that stream payments per second, automate subscriptions, and manage treasuries - all on-chain, transparent, and 50-80% cheaper than traditional processors.

It works in three steps: Create your stream, the contract executes autonomously, recipients withdraw instantly. Everything's transparent and auditable on-chain.

Drip is live on Celo mainnet. Let's automate payments and build trust together. Thank you."
